  title: "Does It Make You Feel Superior To Tear Down Peoples Dreams?",
  body: "Despite her young age, Lisa is able to read people very well. Shes a great judge of character and can see past peoples facades. When they act in certain ways, she is usually able to tell whats driving them to take on such behavior. When she asks the question, “Does it make you feel superior to tear down peoples dreams?” it shows that she understands quite a lot about what makes people tick.\n\nThough most people are intimidated when others try to put them down and discourage them from pursuing their dreams, this behavior is often linked to a persons need to try and make themselves feel superior."

  title: "To Alcohol! The Cause Of... And Solution To... All Of Lifes Problems",
  body: "This quote was mentioned at the end of \"Homer vs the Eighteenth Amendment,\" and since then its left a lasting impression. Parodying the series The Untouchables, the episode focuses on the town prohibiting alcohol after Bart gets intoxicated during a St. Patricks Day celebration.\n\nAfter the prohibition is lifted and the whole town celebrates, Homer uses the quote to close the episode. This quote is famous not just because it addresses the reality behind alcohol consumption, it also reflects an important aspect of Homers personality. The episodes showrunner Josh Weinstein commented that the quote is one of the best and most truthful statements in the series."

  title: 'My Brother Is Using Worms. But I, Who Feel The Tranquility Far Outweighs The Actual Catching Of Fish, Am Using Nothing',
  body: "In the Season Two episode Two Garages in Every Car and Three Eyes on Every Fish, Bart and Lisa are fishing when an investigative journalist shows up and starts chatting to them. When he asks them what they're using for bait, Lisa says, “My brother is using worms. But I, who feel the tranquility far outweighs the actual catching of fish, am using nothing.”\n\nAn eight-year-old kid who is able to be mindful enough to enjoy a relaxing activity like fishing without worrying about the outcome? Sounds like a genius to us."
